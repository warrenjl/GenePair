# GenePair: Statistical Methods for Modeling Spatially-Referenced Paired Genetic Relatedness Data

This package implements a hierarchical Bayesian linear regression analysis to estimate critical windows of susceptibility corresponding to exposure from a single time-varying covariate. The method relies on a temporally structured Gaussian process and is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Similar methods have been used in Warren et al. (2012, 2013) to identify vulnerable periods of pregnancy with respect to ambient air pollution exposure. Please see the "GPCW_Model_Details" and "GPCW_Example" folders for more specific information regarding the statistical model and package use details, respectively.
