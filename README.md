# GenePair: Statistical Methods for Modeling Spatially-Referenced Paired Genetic Relatedness Data

This package implements hierarchical Bayesian regression models to analyze factors associated with genetic similarity between pairs of individuals while accounting for multiple sources of correlation, and is fit using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling techniques. Please see the "GenePair_Model_Details" and "GenePair_Example" folders for more specific information regarding the statistical model and package use details, respectively.
